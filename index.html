                <p class="first-paragraph">Attack on Titan has undergone significant changes throughout its run, evolving so much that the series now feels almost unrecognizable compared to its early seasons, which focused on saving humanity from extinction. This dramatic transformation is one of the key reasons why many regard Attack on Titan as one of the greatest anime ever, a claim that carries substantial weight.</p>
                <p>Although the anime often overshadows the manga, the latter actually excels in several aspects where the show falls short. As the title suggests, a major factor in Attack on Titan's success is the presence of Titans, particularly the Nine Titan Powers that have been passed down through generations of Eldians. These powers, and the characters who inherit them, play a central role in the series' events, showcasing the immense strength of the Eldians and why they've long been feared by humanity. The visual portrayal of these abilities in the anime adds to their impact.</p>

                    The Founding Titan, a key Titan among the Nine, connects all Subjects of Ymir through "paths" and possesses immense powers controlled through screams, historically only usable by the royal bloodline. Known as the "Coordinate," it enables Titan creation, control, memory alteration, body modification, telepathy, and limited future sight. Non-royal inheritors can access its powers when in contact with a royal-blooded Titan.

                <p>
                    <strong>Titan Creation </strong>ability allows the Founding Titan to transform Subjects of Ymir into Titans, even creating enormous Titans like the Colossus Titans that make up the Walls of Paradis Island. 
                    In the other hand, <strong> Titan Control</strong> ability allows the Founding Titan's user to command other Titans and make them follow orders. It was used historically to create armies or form walls and can target "Pure Titans" without range limitations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Memory Manipulation</strong> ability will allow The Founding Titan to alter the memories of Subjects of Ymir. For example, it was used to make people inside the Walls forget pre-Wall history. The Ackerman bloodline and non-Ymir subjects are immune.
                    In addition, the Founding Titan also inhibits <strong> Telephatic Communication</strong> through the "paths" to connect and communicate with all Subjects of Ymir, allowing Eren to announce his plans to all Eldians simultaneously.
                    The Founding Titan can even do an extreme occurence: <strong> Anatomical Manipulation</strong>, which can change the body composition of Subjects of Ymir, such as curing diseases. Zeke Yeager sought to use this power to make Subjects of Ymir sterile as part of a euthanasia plan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last but not least, the Founding Titan is able to let the user view past, present, and future events simultaneously, though this can alter the user’s sense of free will and decision-making : <strong>Clairvoyance</strong>.

                <h2>Jaw Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Speed and Agility, Crushing Strength, and Flying (Falco only)</h3>
                <img
                src="/aot web/assets/jaw-content.png"

                <p>
                    The Jaw Titan is one of the Nine Titans known for its extreme speed, agility, and crushing power in both its jaws and claws. Due to its small size, it can maneuver quickly, making it one of the fastest Titans, especially in tight spaces like Titan Forests. This speed often allows it to surprise other Titans.
                </p>
                <p> The Jaw Titan's <strong>Speed and Agility</strong> comes from his compact form which  gives an outstanding speed and flexibility, allowing it to move faster than most other Titans and to excel in rugged or dense terrain.
                    <strong>Crushing Strength</strong> is his main damage source. Its powerful jaws and claws enable it to bite through nearly anything, including the crystal shell created by the War Hammer Titan—something other Titans couldn’t achieve. The claws and jaws vary depending on the Titan's inheritor, with some inheritors having hardened, armored features for additional durability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Falco Grice, his Jaw Titan form has a unique feature. Due to the influence of the Beast Titan's spinal fluid taken from Zeke Yeager, Falco's Jaw Titan was able to take on several characteristics found in birds. He can <strong>fly</strong>.
                    Falco's Jaw Titan was able to sprout wings and a tail which allowed it to take flight while carrying multiple people on its body.

                <h2>Colossal Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Explosive Transformation, Massive Size, and Steam Emission</h3>
                <img

                <p>
                    The Colossal Titan, one of the Nine Titans in Attack on Titan, is a massive and formidable entity that served as the primary antagonist during much of the anime's first three seasons. Towering at 60 meters, it was an awe-inspiring threat with unique abilities that enabled its users—initially Bertholdt Hoover and later Armin Arlelt—to wreak havoc on cities and armies alike. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The Colossal Titan’s <strong> Explosive Transformation</strong> is especially distinctive, as it allowed the user to unleash varying levels of energy, from powerful shockwaves to cataclysmic explosions that obliterated entire areas. This ability was put to devastating effect during the battle at Shiganshina District, where Bertholdt’s transformation produced a mushroom cloud that wiped out numerous soldiers and part of the city itself. Later, Armin would use this same ability to annihilate the Marleyan naval fleet in a single, massive explosion at the Raid on Liberio. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its <strong> sheer size and physical strength</strong> were equally imposing, allowing it to crush fortified gates with a single kick, toss massive objects into the air, and even trample fleets, as seen when Armin crushed Marleyan ships simply by stepping on them.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the Colossal Titan could <strong> emit vast amounts of steam</strong>, forming a burning barrier that repelled anyone who ventured too close. This steam emission was a versatile tool, although overuse weakened the Titan’s muscles, gradually reducing it to skeletal form. At times, it could even evaporate its body entirely, leaving the user to fall from a great height but potentially escaping dangerous situations. Altogether, the Colossal Titan’s immense size, destructive transformation, and steam manipulation made it a unique and terrifying force in the serie

                <p>
                    The Attack Titan is one of the Nine Titans with a unique power: the ability to see memories of both past and future inheritors. This Titan’s role is tied to freedom, as it has historically fought for liberation across generations.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Unlike other Titans, the Attack Titan <strong>can access memories from future inheritors</strong>. This "power to transcend time" allows present and past inheritors to see visions or memories from their successors, influencing their actions based on future events. For example, Eren Yeager, one of the inheritors, can send memories back to his father, Grisha, who then uses these visions to guide his decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Memory Inheritance power has complex effects. For instance, Grisha receives memories of his son’s future actions, leading him to make decisions that align with Eren’s future goals. However, these future memories are sometimes incomplete, limiting the inheritor's full understanding and occasionally leading to unforeseen consequences. This time-transcending ability makes the Attack Titan unique among the Nine Titans, enabling a cycle of memory inheritance that influences each holder’s choices toward freedom and resistance.

                    The Beast Titan has distinctive abilities that set it apart from other Titans, particularly because it exhibits animal-like traits and can manipulate other Titans. These abilities vary based on the Beast Titan's inheritors, who often resemble various animals, including apes, birds, wolves, and even dinosaurs. Each inheritor's Beast Titan has unique animal characteristics, impacting their abilities in battle.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The Beast Titan manifests <strong>animalistic features</strong> that vary between holders. Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan, for example, had the form of an ape, allowing him certain enhanced abilities like powerful throwing.

                    Spotlighting further to Zeke Yeager's Beast Titan,  he had immense strength and precision when <strong>throwing objects</strong>. He used this skill to devastating effect by hurling rocks and destroying enemy forces, notably in battles at Shiganshina and during the Marley Mid-East War.
                    Zeke’s Beast Titan could also <strong>harden parts of its body</strong>, particularly the nape, for defense. However, the hardening was not strong enough to withstand powerful weapons like Thunder Spears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zeke, because of his royal blood, could <strong>transform Eldians who had ingested his spinal fluid into Titans by using a roar</strong>. This ability was used for strategic attacks, such as turning Ragako villagers into Titans and deploying Titans on the battlefield as part of airstrikes.
                    Zeke could also <strong>control Pure Titans he created</strong> with his scream, commanding them to follow specific orders like remaining still, moving at night using moonlight, and resisting the urge to consume humans. However, his control was imperfect, as some Titans would not fully obey him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These unique abilities made Zeke's Beast Titan one of the most powerful and versatile Titans, with destructive potential that leveraged both brute strength and tactical manipulation of other Titans.

                <h2>War Hammer Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Structural Hardening and Remote Operation</h3>

                <p>
                    The War Hammer Titan is one of the Nine Titans and has unique combat capabilities, primarily due to its ability to create and control hardened Titan structures and operate remotely. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The War Hammer Titan can <strong>generate and manipulate structures made from hardened Titan flesh</strong>. This includes forming a variety of weapons like pikes, hammers, and swords, as well as more flexible weapon elements like crossbow strings or whips. The War Hammer Titan’s hardening allows for powerful, weaponized structures and can also encase its operator in a crystal shell for protection. While highly durable, this crystal can be broken by extremely strong forces, such as the Jaw Titan’s claws and teeth. Overuse of this ability, however, can drain the user’s stamina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other Titans, the War Hammer Titan does not need to be controlled from the nape. Instead, <strong>the human operator can be positioned elsewhere, connected to the Titan body by a cable of flesh</strong>. This cable allows the Titan to be controlled remotely. If the cable is severed, the Titan body is deactivated, but a new body can be created as long as the operator remains safe. This capability allows the War Hammer Titan to emerge from different locations and adds flexibility in battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These abilities make the War Hammer Titan a formidable and versatile force, capable of ranged attacks, remote control, and hardened weaponry for both offense and defense.

                <h2>Cart Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Endurance, Quadrupedal Form, and Speed</h3>
                <img
                src="/aot web/assets/cart-content.jpg"
                alt="Cart Titan"
                class="cart-image-content"
                >                
                <p>
                    The Cart Titan is one of the Nine Titans, recognized for its quadrupedal form and high endurance, making it suitable for long missions, transport, and rapid maneuvers. Its unique physical structure and abilities offer versatility in both combat and support roles.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The Cart Titan <strong>has greater stamina</strong> than other Titans, allowing it to stay in Titan form for extended periods and participate in long missions without rest. Its durability enables repeated transformations, with Pieck, its inheritor, able to transform hundreds of times before tiring. However, it has lower defenses than other Titans and a slower healing rate, making it more vulnerable to critical injuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other Titans, the Cart Titan <strong>moves on all fours</strong>, which supports its "cart" function. This form allows it to carry heavy loads, making it ideal for transporting supplies, troops, and weaponry. The Cart Titan can also be outfitted with weaponry, such as machine gun turrets or anti-Titan cannons, transforming it into a mobile gunnery platform. Extended periods in this form can lead to the inheritor adopting crawling habits, impacting their normal walking ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Cart Titan is <strong>extremely fast</strong>, similar to the Jaw Titan, enabling it to swiftly maneuver on the battlefield. This speed was especially useful in situations like the Battle of Shiganshina, where it could retrieve allies or ambush skilled enemies. These traits make the Cart Titan valuable in both direct combat and support roles, with its endurance, mobility, and adaptability providing strategic advantages.

                <h2>Armored Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Armored Skin and Hardening</h3>
                <img
                src="/aot web/assets/armor-content.png"
                alt="Armored Titan"

                <p>
                    The Armored Titan is one of the Nine Titans, known for its robust, plated armor-like skin that provides powerful defense and offensive capability. Its abilities make it a formidable Titan in battle, although there are limitations to its protective and movement capacities.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>The Armored Titan's body is covered with hardened, armor-like plates</strong> that can withstand substantial damage, including cannon shots and even the Colossus Titan's explosive transformation. The armor not only provides defense but also enables the Titan to use its body as a weapon, delivering high-impact attacks when charging at targets. However, this armor adds weight, reducing the Titan’s speed. To increase agility, the user can shed certain armor sections, such as behind the knees, to move faster. Despite its durability, the armor can be compromised by advanced anti-Titan weaponry. Additionally, if the Founding Titan holder wields enough power, they can shatter the Armored Titan’s skin, leaving it vulnerable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Armored Titan can perform a crystal-like hardening</strong> similar to the Female Titan. This ability enhances the armored segments for defense and offense. The Titan can also harden its hands and feet into claws, allowing it to scale walls or perform strategic attacks. These features make the Armored Titan a powerful defender and close-combat Titan, with its strong armor enabling both offensive and defensive maneuvers, albeit at the cost of some mobility.

                <h2>Female Titan</h2>
                <h3>Abilities : Titan Attraction, Versatility, and Hardening</h3>
                <img

                <p>
                    The Female Titan is one of the Nine Titans, notable for its adaptability, agility, and unique combat abilities, making it a versatile fighter capable of both offensive and strategic maneuvers. It can mimic abilities from other Titans, selectively harden parts of its skin, and attract Pure Titans.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>The Female Titan can attract Pure Titans through a scream-based ability</strong>, similar to the Founding Titan and Beast Titan. When activated, Pure Titans are drawn to it, which Annie Leonhart utilized strategically on Paradis Island. However, this also poses a risk: once they arrive, the Pure Titans will attack and attempt to eat the Female Titan, which can be dangerous for the user. Annie sometimes exploited this by escaping her Titan while others consumed it, using the resulting steam as cover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Female Titan combines agility, endurance, and mobility</strong>, allowing it to cover long distances and sustain prolonged battles. Annie demonstrated this endurance when she traveled extensively across Paradis Island, though the journey was exhausting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Female Titan can harden specific parts of its body</strong>, such as fists, to enhance the force of its attacks. This hardening can shatter ultrahard steel blades and make its melee strikes extremely powerful, capable of dismembering other Titans. Annie also used hardening to encase herself in a crystal cocoon for protection. These abilities make the Female Titan a highly adaptable and resilient fighter, with both defensive and offensive powers that lend themselves to varied combat strategies.
